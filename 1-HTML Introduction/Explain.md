# HTML Introduction
---
### What is HTML?
 - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
 - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

### A Simple HTML Document
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

```
### Example Explained:

- The ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document

- The ```<html>``` element is the root element of an HTML page

- The ```<head>``` element contains meta information about the HTML page

- The``` <title>```element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)

- The ```<body>``` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

- The ```<h1>``` element defines a large heading

- The ```<p>``` element defines a paragraph

# What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

Like This:
```
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
```
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

```html
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

```
<br> <br> <br> 
# Web Browsers?
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:

# HTML Page Structure

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
<strong>Note:</strong> The content inside the ```<body>``` section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the ```<title>``` element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

# HTML History

# HTML vs XHTML: 
<p>HTML (HypertextMarkup Language) and XHTML (ExtensibleHypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used for creating and displaying web pages. The main difference between them is the syntax and structure; HTML is more lenient in its syntax, while XHTML has a more strict syntax and follows XML rules.</p>
