# HTML Text Formatting
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

<br>

### Example: 
<p><b>This text is bold</b></p>
<p><i>This text is italic</i></p>
<p>This is<sub> subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup></p>


# HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

```html
<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

```
# 1- HTML `<b>` and `<strong>` Elements
The HTML `<b>` element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

Example:
```html
<b>This text is bold</b>
```

The HTML `<strong>` element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

Example:

```html
<strong>This text is important!</strong>

``` 

# 2- HTML `<i>` and `<em>` Elements

The HTML `<i>` element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: The `<i>` tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

```html
<i>This text is italic</i>
```

The HTML `<em>` element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in `<em> `with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

```html
<em>This text is emphasized</em>
```

# 3- HTML `<small>` Element

The HTML `<small>` element defines smaller text:
```html

<small>This is some smaller text.</small>

```

# 4- HTML `<mark>` Element
The HTML `<mark>` element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:

```html
<p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
```

# 5- HTML `<ins>` Element
The HTML `<ins>` element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:

```html
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
```

# 6- HTML `<sub>` Element
The HTML `<sub>`element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:

```html
<p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
```
# 6- HTML `<sup>` Element
The HTML `<sup>` element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW<sup>1</sup>:
```html
<p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>
```
